Basically serial is finished.
I made sure to keep it open to being parallelized with CUDA.
I recommend reading it from point to kMeans to main. Main itself does not mean much so don't pay too much attention to it. It serves solely as a driver.

Waiting for further direction to see how MPI & CUDA Will play out.

Have begun on fuzzy c-means clustering
