The project's code segments are fairly well commented. 
This is largely only intended to be used as a reference.
The focus of this project was to showcase the performance differnces in Fuzzy C-Means clustering and K-Means clustering which made use of OpenMPI and CUDA in each implementation.
Thus, comparing the benefits of a chosen framework.
It should be noted, this made use of global memory in the case of CUDA which is sub-optimal for this problem but served the purpose of a basic CUDA implementation.
