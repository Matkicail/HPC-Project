Note for Jared:

Serial K-means should be working.
I am starting on the CUDA side of it.

There exsists some issue in fuzzy-means. I have noted it where it is the problem, but to make it known now it is calculateCentroids in fuzzyMeans.h.

I rewrote almost all code for fuzzy-means as there was some underlying issue in it. 
It basically had non-deterministic errors.
This being as unusual as it is, I tried to troubleshoot it but could not pinpoint it, hence the whole rewrite.
